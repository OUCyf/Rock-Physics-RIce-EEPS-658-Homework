Considering the increasing risks of climate change, Geological Carbon Storage is an important topic in todayâ€™s world,
which inject large amounts of CO2 into underground rocks for long time storage.
This process is challenging, we need to ensure that the injected $CO_2$ will not leak or run away, and provide powerful monitoring tools.
Thus, in this project I propose to forward the model with a 2-D simulation of $CO_2$ injection into a fullsize proxy reservoir and 
 analyze the evolution characteristics of $CO_2$ injection,
 and use the White and Dutta-Ode model to discuss the changes in velocity and Q value.
